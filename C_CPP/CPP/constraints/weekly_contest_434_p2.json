At timestamp 10, id1 and id0 are mentioned. mentions = [1,1]. At timestamp 11, id0 goes offline. At timestamp 71, id0 comes back online and \"HERE\" is mentioned. mentions = [2,2].",

At timestamp 10, id1 and id0 are mentioned. mentions = [1,1]. At timestamp 11, id0 goes offline. At timestamp 12, \"ALL\" is mentioned. This includes offline users, so both id0 and id1 are mentioned. mentions = [2,2].",
            "Example 3: Input: numberOfUsers = 2, events = [[\"OFFLINE\",\"10\",\"0\"],[\"MESSAGE\",\"12\",\"HERE\"]] Output: [0,1] Explanation: Initially, all users are online. At timestamp 10, id0 goes offline. At timestamp 12, \"HERE\" is mentioned. Because id0 is still offline, they will not be mentioned. mentions = [0,1]."
