For nums[1] that is equal to -2, If we move 2 steps to left, we reach nums[3]. So result[1] should be 1. For nums[2] that is equal to 1, If we move 1 step to right, we reach nums[3]. So result[2] should be 1. For nums[3] that is equal to 1, If we move 1 step to right, we reach nums[0]. So result[3] should be 3.",
