Worker 1 reduces the height by 2, taking workerTimes[1] + workerTimes[1] * 2 = 3 seconds. Worker 2 reduces the height by 1, taking workerTimes[2] = 1 second. Since they work simultaneously, the minimum time needed is max(2, 3, 1) = 3 seconds.",

Worker 1 reduces the height by 3, taking workerTimes[1] + workerTimes[1] * 2 + workerTimes[1] * 3 = 12 seconds. Worker 2 reduces the height by 3, taking workerTimes[2] + workerTimes[2] * 2 + workerTimes[2] * 3 = 12 seconds. Worker 3 reduces the height by 2, taking workerTimes[3] + workerTimes[3] * 2 = 12 seconds. The number of seconds needed is max(9, 12, 12, 12) = 12 seconds."
