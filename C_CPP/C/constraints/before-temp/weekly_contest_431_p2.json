There is no index j that satisfies the conditions, so we skip. i = 2. The closest index j that satisfies the conditions is j = 0, so we mark both indices 0 and 2, and then add 2 - 0 = 2 to the score. i = 3. There is no index j that satisfies the conditions, so we skip. i = 4. The closest index j that satisfies the conditions is j = 1, so we mark both indices 1 and 4, and then add 4 - 1 = 3 to the score.",
